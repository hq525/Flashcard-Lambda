# Flashcard Lambda

Go AWS Lambda backend for a flashcard application, fronted by API Gateway with DynamoDB for persistence and S3 for image storage.

## Architecture

```
API Gateway → Lambda Handler → Router (methods.go) → Controllers → DynamoDB / S3
```

**Request flow:**
1. `cmd/lambda/main.go` — entry point; initializes AWS clients and starts the Lambda handler
2. `cmd/lambda/api/methods.go` — routes by HTTP method and path to the appropriate controller
3. `internal/controllers/` — business logic per resource
4. `internal/models/` — DynamoDB data models
5. `internal/persistence/` — DAO interfaces

**Environment variables:**

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `DYNAMODB_TABLE` | DynamoDB table name (e.g. `flash-card-app` for prod, `flash-card-app-dev` for dev) |
| `S3_BUCKET` | S3 bucket for card question images (e.g. `flash-card-app-images` for prod, `flash-card-app-images-dev` for dev) |
| `S3_ANSWER_IMAGE_BUCKET` | S3 bucket for card answer section images (e.g. `flash-card-app-answer-images` for prod, `flash-card-app-answer-images-dev` for dev) |

Set these in the Lambda function configuration. AWS Lambda makes them available to the process at runtime via `os.Getenv`.

## Data Model

```
Category
└── Deck
    └── Card
        ├── CardAnswerSection (ordered by sequence_number)
        │   └── CardAnswerSectionImage (ordered by sequence_number)
        └── CardQuestionImage (ordered by sequence_number)

Tag  (associated with Cards via tag_ids)
```

| GET | `/presigned-url` | Get a pre-signed S3 URL for image upload (`imageType=answer` for answer section images, omit for question images) |

All responses include CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`).

## Configuration

The function requires two environment variables. Set them in the Lambda function configuration for each environment (prod and dev).

**AWS Console:**
1. Open the [Lambda console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda) and select your function
2. Go to **Configuration → Environment variables → Edit**
3. Add the following key-value pairs and click **Save**

| Key | Example value |
|---|---|
| `DYNAMODB_TABLE` | `flash-card-app` |
| `S3_BUCKET` | `flash-card-app-images` |
| `S3_ANSWER_IMAGE_BUCKET` | `flash-card-app-answer-images` |

**AWS CLI:**
```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name <your-function-name> \
  --environment "Variables={DYNAMODB_TABLE=flash-card-app,S3_BUCKET=flash-card-app-images,S3_ANSWER_IMAGE_BUCKET=flash-card-app-answer-images}"
```

For the dev function, use the dev resource names:
```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name <your-dev-function-name> \
  --environment "Variables={DYNAMODB_TABLE=flash-card-app-dev,S3_BUCKET=flash-card-app-images-dev,S3_ANSWER_IMAGE_BUCKET=flash-card-app-answer-images-dev}"
```

**Local testing:**

Set the variables in your shell before running:
```bash
export DYNAMODB_TABLE=flash-card-app-dev
export S3_BUCKET=flash-card-app-images-dev
export S3_ANSWER_IMAGE_BUCKET=flash-card-app-answer-images-dev
```

## Development

**Prerequisites:** Go 1.24+, AWS credentials configured

```bash
# Build Lambda binary (Linux/ARM64 for AWS deployment)
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o bootstrap ./cmd/lambda/

# Build for local/testing
go build ./...

# Run tests
go test ./...

# Run tests for a single package
go test ./internal/controllers/...

# Tidy dependencies
go mod tidy

# Vet code
go vet ./...
```
